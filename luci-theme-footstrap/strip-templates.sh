# Strip `{# … #}` template comments from the .ut files IN A BUILD TREE.
#
#   ./strip-templates.sh <dir>
#
# Run from the package Makefile (Build/Prepare) over $(PKG_BUILD_DIR), never over the source tree:
# git keeps every word, the router does not need any of them. Same trade this project already makes
# for JS (jsmin/terser) and CSS (build-css.sh) — templates were simply never included in it, and
# they are 58% comments. `{# … #}` alone is 16112 of 39426 bytes (41%).
#
# sh + awk only, like build-css.sh: an OpenWrt buildbot has no node and this must not become the
# reason a build needs one.
#
# WHAT IS AND IS NOT TOUCHED, and the distinction is the whole safety argument:
#   * `{# … #}` — a TEMPLATE comment. ucode treats `{#` as a comment opener everywhere outside a
#     `{% … %}` code block, so a `{#` that survives in this tree is a comment BY DEFINITION; if one
#     ever sat inside a <script> string the template would already be broken. Verified before
#     writing this: 0 of them appear inside a code block, and every opener has exactly one closer.
#   * `/* … */` inside `{% … %}` — a ucode CODE comment, 6844 bytes more. NOT touched. Stripping it
#     needs a lexer that knows ucode strings, and 17 of the `/*` in this tree sit OUTSIDE any code
#     block (they are CSS/JS comments in inline <style>/<script>). That is exactly the shape that
#     made the old `sed 's/;}/}/g'` in build-css.sh eat a data-URI: a scanner that cannot see
#     strings. Not worth 6.8 KB.
#
# Whitespace control is EMULATED, not ignored: `{#- …` also eats the whitespace before the comment
# and `… -#}` the whitespace after it, which is how ucode itself renders them. Every .ut here opens
# with a licence block closing `-#}` to swallow the newline before <!DOCTYPE html>; dropping the
# comment without the trim would put that newline back.
