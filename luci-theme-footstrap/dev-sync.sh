# root/ -> / as a TREE, never as a list of names. luci.mk installs root/ wholesale, so a file named
# here one-by-one is a file that ships in the package and silently never reaches the dev router —
# first noticed after a release. The top-level dirs come from a GLOB for the same reason: this used
# to tar `usr` literally, which is a hand-written list of one, and root/etc/ was the counterexample
# already sitting in the tree — root/etc/config/footstrap shipped in the package and never reached
# the router. tar, not `scp -r`, because scp's merge semantics on an existing /usr are ambiguous.
#
# Two subtrees have semantics a blind tar would break, so each is excluded and handled explicitly
# below. Both exclusions are about BEHAVIOUR, not about naming files: a new file under either dir
# still arrives for free.
#   - etc/uci-defaults: deliberately run from /tmp (see below). Landing it in /etc/uci-defaults
#     would make the router's next boot execute it and then DELETE it.
#   - etc/config: conffiles. The package manager does not overwrite them on upgrade (Makefile's
#     conffiles define) and neither may dev-sync — the live file holds the admin's "Save as
#     default", and clobbering it here would be the very wipe that define exists to prevent.
