 *
 * Kills the full page reload for `view`-type menu nodes — 54 of 74 menu leaves (~73%) on the dev
 * router; the rest are call/function/template. LuCI already renders every page client-side into
 * #view; only NAVIGATION is server-dispatched. So intercept link clicks and re-instantiate the
 * target view in place — what the dispatcher's view.ut does via ui.instantiateView(), minus the
 * reload. Purely additive: anything that is not a satisfied `view` node (call/function/template/
 * alias/firstchild, external, download, cross-origin, modified click) or any error falls through to
 * a normal navigation, and deep links / F5 keep working because we pushState the real URL.
 *
 * Re-instantiation: L.require('view.x') returns a cached SINGLETON whose __init__ (the render)
 * already ran, so calling it again repaints nothing. Take the class off the instance
 * (prototype.constructor) and `new v.constructor()` for a fresh __init__ → load()+render(), which is
 * what a full load does anyway. docs/14.
 *
 * The path->node half lives in fs-menutree.js (the chrome needs it too); the "has a view poisoned
 * this document with its CSS?" half in fs-sheets.js. */

 * every page afterwards.
 *

 * way a fresh load leaves it" routine. push=false — the URL never moved, only the DOM under it; if
 * it declines (the superseded view injected CSS), the reload does it the hard way. The className

/* ---- the generation must be checked at the PAINT, not at the dispatch ----
 *
 * _navGen is checked once, in the require() callback, i.e. BEFORE `new view.constructor()`. But a
 * view's __init__ is async — `ready.then(this.load).then(this.render).then(nodes =>
 * dom.content(document.getElementById('view'), nodes))` — so the DOM write happens two awaits later,
 * and every await is a point at which the whole event loop runs, another navigation included. The
 * dispatch-time check has expired by the time it matters.
 *
 * Measured on the router: leave the (cached) package manager for System after 150 ms, and the paints
 * into #view land 16010 System, 16490 package-manager — the view we walked away from paints LAST and
 * wins, permanently. URL, <title>, data-page and the menu highlight all say System; #view shows
 * Software. Only a reload clears it. The cached path is the COMMON one — after warm-up every
 * navigation takes it — and it had no guard at all: repairStaleRender() is called only when !cached.
 *
 * The fix has to be a paint-time check, and there are two constraints on where it can live.
 * ClassConstructor DISCARDS __init__'s return value (`this.__init__.apply(this, arguments)`, no
 * return), so the construction promise is unreachable — nothing to await. But __init__ resolves
 * `this.render` while it builds its chain, i.e. during `new`, so a wrapper installed on the
 * prototype BEFORE the construct is the one that gets bound. `new` then returns synchronously (the
 * first load() is already a microtask), which is what makes stamping the generation on the INSTANCE
 * right after it safe — and it must be the instance, not a map keyed by class name, or A → B → A
 * with everything cached would have the second construct's generation overwrite the first's.
 *
 * A superseded render resolves to a promise that never settles: the chain simply stops before
 * dom.content(), so nothing paints and addFooter() never runs. Returning empty nodes instead would
 * paint the emptiness over the live page, and throwing would hand LuCI's own .catch an error box to
 * render into the page we just opened.
 *
 * A view instance we did not construct (the singleton require() builds on a FIRST visit — the render

 * because Poll.start() dispatches `poll-start` only when the queue is non-empty — an unpolled page

 * DOES dispatch `poll-stop`, so walking from a polled page to an unpolled one left a "Paused" pill
 * reporting on a poll that does not exist there. Rule: the pill exists iff there is something to
 * poll. Registered at module eval, i.e. AFTER luci.js's own listener, so ours runs second and can
