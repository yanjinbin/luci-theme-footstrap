# The SPA router

How the theme removes the full page reload when you click a menu item, and the rules a client
router has to follow to stay correct.

Lives in `htdocs/luci-static/resources/fs-router.js`; path→node resolution in `fs-menutree.js`
(also read by the chrome), the foreign-CSS gate in `fs-sheets.js`. **No changes to the server,
luci-base or the templates** — this is purely additive theme JS.

## Why it is possible at all

LuCI 25.12 is a classic MPA: every click is a full GET and the ucode dispatcher re-emits the whole
page shell. But **the content is already rendered on the client**: for a `view` node the dispatcher
renders `view.ut`, which emits `<div id="view">` plus an inline
`L.require('ui').then(ui => ui.instantiateView(path))`.

So the server controls *navigation*, not *rendering*. The router repeats exactly what `view.ut`
does, minus the reload: intercept the click, re-instantiate the view into the existing `#view`,
update the URL with `history.pushState`.

Count clickable nodes, not leaves — the ones `ui.menu.getChildren()` turns into an `<a href>`
(`satisfied` plus a title). A node with an `action` can have children (`admin/status/nftables`),
while `rpc/*`, `admin/uci/*` and `admin/menu` never become links. On the test router that is **65**
nodes, of which SPA serves **62**:

| type | count | SPA |
|---|--:|---|
| `view` | 54 | yes |
| `alias`, `firstchild` | 10 | yes — resolved to a leaf |
| `template` (overview) | 1 | yes — special case |
| `call` (Lua CBI) | 1 | no — server-rendered |
| `function` (`admin/logout`) | 1 | no — and does not need to be |
| `firstchild` → into a `call` | 1 | no |

So the only non-SPA nodes are the ones with no client view class in principle.

## alias / firstchild resolved on the client

This was the router's blind spot: 7 of the 27 links the menu draws (Firewall, System Log, Realtime
Graphs, Administration, Terminal, …) are not pages but redirects. `viewClassFor` saw a non-`view`
and fell back to a full load — meaning **the most-clicked menu items reloaded the page**.

The server does not redirect them: `GET /admin/status/logs` answers **200 on the same URL** and
resolves the leaf internally — `pathinfo` stays the requested path while
`requestpath`/`dispatchpath`/`nodespec`/`ctx.path` already carry `…/logs/syslog`. The client does
the same:

- `resolveSegs()` walks `alias` (jump to `action.path` from the root) and `firstchild` (pick a
  child) until it reaches a real node; a hop counter catches a cycle in a foreign `menu.d`.
- `firstChildOf()`/`nodeWeight()` are a port of `resolve_firstchild()`/`node_weight()` from
  `dispatcher.uc`, not a paraphrase: weight `min(order ?? 9999, 9999)` plus 10000 for a node with
  `auth.login`, the `satisfied`/`title`/`firstchild_ineligible` filters, recursion into a nested
  `firstchild`, ties broken by key order. The ACL check is skipped: the tree the client gets from
  `/admin/menu` is already filtered by the session's ACL.
- `navigate()` keeps both tracks: `segs` (what was clicked) goes to `pushState` and `pathinfo`;
  `rsegs` (the resolved leaf) goes to `requestpath`/`dispatchpath`/`nodespec`/`data-page`/title —
  exactly as a full load does.

Accuracy here is not aesthetics: pick a different child and a click opens one page while F5 on the
same URL opens another. `rewrite` is deliberately not resolved — it is not in the tree, and a
mistake in `splice` semantics would open the wrong page, which is worse than the reload it
falls back to.

## The navigation flow

`wireRouter()` puts one delegated handler on `document`:

1. A click on an `<a href>`, no modifiers, button 0, not `target=_blank`, not `download`, same
   origin, href not `#…`. Links with a `?query` or `#hash` also go to a full load: `navigate()`
   carries only the pathname, and `pushState` of a bare path would drop both (views read
   `location.search`). For the same reason, `popstate` onto an entry with a query is just
   `location.reload()`.
2. `navigate(pathname, push=true)`:
   - `segsFromPath` strips `L.env.scriptname` into path segments;
   - `documentPoisoned()` — has an invasive foreign stylesheet poisoned the document? If so,
     `return false`;
   - `nodeForSegs` walks the menu tree; `viewClassFor` gives the view class name, or `null` if the
     node is not SPA-able;
   - **no class → `return false`** → the handler does not `preventDefault` → the browser loads the
     page normally;
   - otherwise: teardown → update `L.env` → `body[data-page]` → `pushState` (or **`replaceState`**
     if the already-open page was clicked — a second entry would make one Back press dead) →
     `renderChrome()` → `scrollTo(0, 0)` → focus `#maincontent` and announce the new title in the
     polite live region → re-instantiate the view;
   - `return true` → `preventDefault`.

   Every committed navigation increments `_navGen`.
3. `popstate` (back/forward): `navigate(location.pathname, push=false)`; a non-SPA-able node →
   `location.reload()`. Two guards first: an entry with a `?query` reloads immediately, and **a
   fragment change is not a navigation** — Chrome fires `popstate` for a same-document `#` jump, so
   a click on `<a href="#">` inside a view arrived here as "the user pressed Back" and the router
   re-instantiated the view, wiping the state that click had just set (issue #3:
   `luci-app-filemanager`'s tab strip is four `<a href="#">` whose handler never calls
   `preventDefault`). If `location.pathname === _curPath`, the page owns the fragment; return.

Because `pushState` stores the real dispatcher URL, F5 and deep links work server-side
unchanged.

The router re-stamps `document.body[data-page]` itself, from the resolved leaf path
(`rsegs.join('-')`), exactly as the server stamps `ctx.path` on a full load. Otherwise the incoming
page would keep the previous page's `data-page` and the page-scoped CSS in `styles/pages/*` would
silently not apply.

## Re-instantiating a view — the main subtlety

`require()` in LuCI returns an instance, not a class: the first require constructs the object,
and a view's `__init__` *is* its render (that is all `ui.instantiateView()` does). The router used
to `require()` and then build a second instance on top — the page rendered twice and ran **two
pollers**, permanently doubling the RPC rate. So a new instance is built only on a repeat visit.
A page that arrived by full load is already instantiated by LuCI, so its class is seeded into
`_seen` at init — otherwise the first SPA return to it would render nothing. The benchmark found
this; the double render is invisible to the eye.

On a repeat visit, require hands back a singleton whose `__init__` has already run, so calling it
again repaints nothing. The class is taken from the instance — LuCI's class system sets
`ClassConstructor.prototype.constructor = ClassConstructor`, so `instance.constructor` is the class,
and `new instance.constructor()` runs a fresh `__init__` → fresh `load()` + `render()` into `#view`.
Identical to a full load, which also always starts from a new instance.

### The generation check must sit at the PAINT, not at the dispatch

`AbortController` is hygiene; a monotonic generation counter is correctness. The primary source is
blunt about it:

> "It's ok to call `.abort()` after the fetch has already completed, fetch simply ignores it."
> — Chrome, *Abortable fetch*

`abort()` cancels neither an already-arrived response nor an already-running handler, and
**`L.Request` in LuCI is XHR that never exposes its `xhr` handle at all** — there is nothing to
abort. Meanwhile every `await` between the check and the DOM write is a point where the whole event
loop turns, including an entire foreign navigation.

The router checked the generation before constructing rather than at the paint:

```js
if (gen !== _navGen) { if (!cached) repairStaleRender(className); return; }
if (cached) new view.constructor();
```

`View.__init__` is asynchronous (`ready.then(load).then(render).then(nodes => DOM.content(#view,
nodes))`), so the write happened two awaits later — and `repairStaleRender()` only ran when
`!cached`, leaving the cached path unprotected, which is the ordinary path once the cache is
warm. Reproduced: leave a slow cached view (Software) for a fast one (System) after 150 ms and the
result was stable until F5 — System's URL, title, `data-page` and menu highlight, with Software's
content in `#view`.

It could not be fixed head-on: `ClassConstructor` discards what `__init__` returns, so the
construction promise is unreachable. But `__init__` resolves `this.render` while building its chain
— that is, **during `new`** — so a wrapper installed on `prototype.render` before `new` is the
one that gets bound, and `new` returns synchronously, so the generation can be stamped on the
**instance** immediately after. On the instance, not in a by-class-name map: A → B → A on a warm
cache would overwrite the first construction's generation with the second's.

A stale render returns a promise that never resolves: the chain simply stops before
`dom.content()`. Returning empty nodes would paint a live page blank; throwing would hand LuCI's
`.catch` an error box to draw into a page that just opened.

An instance we did not create (the singleton from `require()` on a first visit, where render
*is* require and there is nothing to arm) carries no stamp and is left alone — that is what
`repairStaleRender()` still covers.

**A URL is not a valid token**: A→B→A gives two different navigations with the same URL.

### Fast double-click on UNCACHED views

`_navGen` cancels a stale navigation only on the cached path, where cancelling means "do not
call `new view.constructor()`". On a first visit `require()` *is* the render, inside a promise
we do not own.

So: click Firewall (not cached), click Wireless 100 ms later. `navigate(Wireless)` flushes the
`L.Poll` queue before Firewall adds its poller; Firewall finishes drawing into a `#view` that
now belongs to Wireless and registers a poller the flush already missed. What is left is Wireless's
URL, title, menu and `data-page` with Firewall's content and Firewall's poller — forever.

Fixed by navigating again: `repairStaleRender(className)` calls `navigate(_curPath, false)` —
`navigate()` *is* the procedure for returning the document to the state a fresh load leaves.
`push=false` because the URL never moved, only the DOM under it. If `navigate()` refuses (the stale
view injected invasive CSS) → `location.reload()`, hard.

Recursion terminates on `currentViewClass()`: if the stale render happened to draw exactly the class
`_curPath` wants (A → B → A while A was still loading), the DOM and poller are correct and there is
nothing to repair.

## The two `L` trap

`L` inside a module (the factory parameter) and `window.L` (the runtime instance the dispatcher
creates) are different objects. `ui` hangs its helpers (`itemlist`, `showModal`, `hideTooltip`)
on `window.L`, not on the prototypal `L` factories receive. A required module captures whichever `L`
`require()` was called on.

So a view must be required through `window.L`, or it captures the helper-less `L` and dies
mid-render on the first `L.itemlist(...)`. In the code: `const RT = window.L; RT.require(className)`.

**The trap propagates down the chain, and the cache makes it a race.** `view/status/index.js` loads
its includes with its own `L`, so the `L` that index.js got is also what `30_network.js` gets —
and that one calls `L.itemlist(...)` directly. One wrong `require` at the top kills the render three
modules down. And because `require()` caches by class name, the class↔`L` binding is fixed by the
**first** requirer: on a full load that is always the dispatcher with `window.L`, but on an SPA
transition it can be any theme module that touches a stock class. That is exactly what
`fs-overview.js` did — `patchOverview()` required `view.status.index` through its prototypal `L`,
beat the router's `RT.require`, and the overview died on `L.itemlist is not a function` with
"Loading view…" on screen. "Sometimes, and only when coming from another page" is precisely why.

**Rule: any require of a STOCK class from theme code goes through `window.L`** — not only in the
router. `L.env` and `L.Poll` are shared (closure/singleton), so those can be reached through either;
only the `require` target matters.

## Teardown

Before rendering the new view:

- **Polling is returned to the state a fresh load leaves it in** — all three steps are required:

  ```js
  L.Poll.queue.length = 0;   // the outgoing view's pollers
  L.Poll.stop();             // drop its tick
  L.Poll.start();            // on an EMPTY queue: tick = 0, no timer armed
  ```

  *The flush* stops the departed page's pollers hammering detached DOM and burning RPC. The only
  non-view poller LuCI adds is a transient reachability check during apply/reboot, so clearing the
  queue is safe.

  *One flush is not enough.* LuCI keeps one tick per second and runs a queue entry only when
  `tick % interval == 0`. The outgoing page's surviving tick made the incoming view's poller
  wait for the next multiple of its interval — up to 5 s. Wireless draws its station list from the
  first poll and sat spinning for **4950 ms** against ~360 ms on a full load.

  *One `stop()` is not enough either*, which is why there are three steps: `stop()` removes
  `tick`, and `Poll.add()` only auto-starts when `tick != null`, so the page would not poll at all.
  `stop()` + `start()` on an empty queue gives exactly what a fresh document has. This is not a
  workaround — it is literally upstream's sequence: on a full load `initDOM()` calls `Poll.start()`
  on an empty queue before the view renders.
- The "Refreshing"/"Paused" indicator used to outlive its own polling: LuCI shows it on `poll-start`,
  switches it on `poll-stop` and never hides it again, while our `stop()` dispatches `poll-stop`
  on every navigation — so moving from a polling page to a non-polling one left "Paused" about
  polling that did not exist. Our own `poll-stop` listener (registered at module eval, therefore
  after LuCI's, therefore running second) hides the pill when the queue is empty.
- `clearViewIntervals()` kills the outgoing view's bare `window.setInterval`s. A full load would
  have killed them; SPA must do it explicitly. `setInterval`/`clearInterval` are hooked at module
  eval and the ids tracked in a `Set`; `L.Poll`'s own 1-second tick is preserved.
- Running the registered navigation callbacks — **and the router names none of them**. The seam is
  inverted: `fs-router.js` exports `onNavigate(fn)` and a module registers itself, so an optional
  module that is not installed is not a `DependencyError` that takes out the chrome. The search
  palette uses it today (recent pages, close on navigate); it was written for the retired updater's
  poll cancel.
- `ui.hideModal()`.

### `renderChrome()`

After `L.env` changes (`requestpath`/`dispatchpath`/`pathinfo`/`nodespec`), rebuilds the mode menu,
the main menu and the section tabs. The containers are cleared first so nothing duplicates.
`document.title` and `.fs-title-main` are updated too.

## Foreign view CSS: a gate, not a sweep

A `<style>`/`<link>` a view wrote into `<head>` dies with the document on a full load — but
**survives an SPA transition** and paints every page afterwards. `luci-app-filemanager` injects
`.cbi-button-apply, .cbi-button-reset, .cbi-button-save:not(.custom-save-button) { display: none
!important }` — unlayered *and* important, so it beats every cascade layer: one visit and Save/Reset
vanished from every config page.

**Removing them on navigation is not an option** — it was tried, and it broke SSClash. A poller is
recoverable by re-rendering the view; a stylesheet comes back only if the injector runs again,
and a library that imports CSS at module eval never runs again (the module is cached for the life of
the document). `ace_editor.css` (14 KB of absolutely positioned layers) is imported once — after a
sweep, returning to the editor gave a black rectangle 2 007 346 px tall. **Deletion is silently
one-way.**

Hence: **`documentPoisoned()` before every navigation.** An invasive sheet in the document →
`navigate()` returns `false` → an ordinary full load. Speed is traded for correctness, never the
other way; a fresh document carries no view CSS, so SPA resumes immediately.

`VIEW_SHEETS` is `style:not([data-fs-shell]), link[rel~="stylesheet"]:not([data-fs-shell])`. The
`<link>` half is not hypothetical: `luci-app-banip`/`luci-app-adblock` append a `<link …/custom.css>`
at module eval, and it paints `.cbi-input-text` / `.cbi-input-select` — stock widgets, on every page,
unlayered. Excluded: `[data-fs-shell]` (the one `<style>` the server emits is marked, not
guessed) and everything inside `#view` (it dies with the content). LuCI's core injects no runtime
`<style>` at all (checked in `luci.js`, `ui.js`, `cbi.js`).

**The universe of theme names is read from `cascade.css` itself** (`themeNames()`; same-origin, so
`cssRules` is readable) — every class/id the theme styles and every custom property it declares or
reads. Not a hand-written list: that would fall behind the theme on day one. An unreadable sheet
(still loading, 404, cross-origin) or an unreadable `cascade.css` is **invasive by default**: unknown
CSS takes the slow path, not the broken one. The whole gate costs ~0.3 ms per navigation.

Three tests in `invasiveSheet()`:

1. **A bare type selector** (`pre`, `*`, `:root`, `svg text` — no class, id or attribute) matches
   stock markup on any page → invasive. Unless its declarations are inert:
   `inertDeclarations()` passes a rule that declares only custom properties the theme does not
   read — it cannot paint us. `luci-app-temp-status` opens with `:root { --app-temp-status-temp: … }`
   and would otherwise poison the document on selector shape alone. Invasive: any standard
   property on a bare selector (stock filemanager writes `:root { color-scheme: light dark }`, which
   re-points every UA widget at the OS setting) and any custom property the theme *does* read —
   which is the point of the private `--fs-*` tier.
2. **A stock name with no anchor.** A rule can name a stock widget and still be harmless if it can
   only match inside its own app's markup: `#cbi-podkop-section > .cbi-section-remove` requires a
   podkop section. What pins it down is a name the theme does not know — the app's own. A
   selector built entirely from names the theme knows is pinned by nothing and matches the same
   widgets on anyone's page → invasive.
3. **Functional pseudo-class arguments are stripped** before looking for the anchor — and that is
   the whole difference between podkop and filemanager. `.cbi-button-save:not(.custom-save-button)`
   also names an app class, but **inside a negation**: it does not require that markup, it excludes it.

**The only safe removal is a byte-identical second copy.** Not removing is expensive where an app
injects on every render: podkop calls `injectGlobalStyles()` from `render()` (4 KB, unguarded)
and `luci-app-mosdns` re-attaches three CodeMirror `<link>`s, so every SPA visit adds a copy the
browser parses forever. An exact duplicate is safe to drop for the same reason sweeping was not: the
rules do not go anywhere — the surviving copy is byte-identical, and a library's "have I imported
this already?" check still finds its sheet. **The FIRST copy is kept**: that is the one the app holds
a handle to. `watchViewSheets()` observes `<head>` rather than sweeping on navigation, because podkop
injects from `render()`, which resolves after the router's `require()` callback — sweeping on
navigation left the document carrying one permanently stale copy. The observer cannot loop: a removal
is a mutation with no added nodes, and the handler returns when nothing was added.

## Module prefetch

`wireRouter()` adds a delegated `pointerover`: entering a link to an SPA-able node `fetch()`es its
JS module to warm the browser's HTTP cache — not `require`, which would run `__init__` and render
a foreign view into `#view`. The URL is built by `moduleUrl()` byte-for-byte as `LuCI.require()`
builds it, or it misses the cache. Deduplicated by class name; errors are swallowed.

**The walk is transitive, and that is most of the win.** Warming one view class leaves its own
`require` pragmas an extra round trip away: `view/network/routes.js` pulls `tools/network.js`
(40.5 KB). The root's bytes are already in hand, so the body is scanned for pragmas for free and
what it finds is warmed by the same `fetch()`. Measured at 120 ms RTT, first visit:
`network/routes` 418 ms with only the view warmed against **296 ms** with dependencies — exactly one
RTT. Across six pages: 1713 ms without prefetch → 1184 → **1052**.

Three traps, each one actually hit:

- **Pragmas cannot be scanned line by line.** On a router the files are minified and every pragma is
  on one line, so `/^'require …'$/m` finds nothing — silently. The first version of this feature
  measured its own gain as zero because of it. `luci.js` lexes the leading string literals; we read
  the same file head with one regex.
- **Six class names have no file**, and requesting one is a guaranteed 404 in the user's console.
  `luci.js` keeps its registry as a literal (`baseclass`, `dom`, `poll`, `request`, `session`,
  `view`) and answers `require()` for them from memory. Every view file's pragmas name `view` and
  `baseclass`, so the walk trips on this at the first step. `BUILTIN_CLASSES` is that literal copied
  from `luci.js`, not a guess about it.
- **Speculation stops under an already-clicked link** (`_committed`). After the click, `require()`
  fetches the same graph and parallelises parsing with loading; our walk would only race it.
  Measured at 120 ms RTT: 658 ms waiting for the whole subtree against 525 ms racing — for a
  duplicate that stopping avoids entirely.

**A click waits for an unfinished prefetch rather than racing it** (`warmedThen()`). Two requests for
one URL are not coalesced, so a click that lands before the prefetch finishes downloads the module
**twice**, both at full latency, and gains nothing. On a **touch device this is the normal case**:
`pointerover` arrives at the same moment as the tap. Waiting costs nothing — the XHR would have
waited for those bytes anyway — but is capped by `WARM_WAIT_MS` so a hung prefetch cannot hang the
navigation.

**Three triggers, because a pointer is not the only way to choose a link.** A keyboard user tabs to
a link and presses Enter, producing no pointer event at all — `focusin` covers that.
`pointerdown` adds the one case `pointerover` misses: a link that scrolled under a stationary
cursor crosses no boundary and fires nothing.

**Recent-page warming** lives in `fs-search.js` (`warmRecent()`), because the recents list belongs to
the palette; the edge points `search → router` through the exported `prefetchSegs` so the router need
not know about the palette. At most 5 entries, the current page excluded, `requestIdleCallback` with
a timeout, and a full opt-out on `navigator.connection.saveData` — speculation should be the first
thing to go on a metered link, while hover prefetch stays (there is a deliberate gesture behind it).
Walking the whole menu instead would pull every view module on the box. Measured at 120 ms RTT with a
cold HTTP cache and **no hover at all**: `network/routes` 289 ms against 553 cold, `network/dhcp`
315 against 443, `system/system` 288 against 421.

## Background polling pause

`wireVisibility()`: `visibilitychange` → a hidden tab does `L.Poll.stop()` (clearInterval, queue
intact), showing does `L.Poll.start()` (re-arm plus an immediate `step()`). LuCI has no handler of
its own, so status/overview in a background tab otherwise hammers ubus 24/7 (the expensive iwinfo
`getAssocList`). Only what we paused is resumed (`wasActive`) — the user may have stopped polling by
hand through the "Refreshing" indicator, and an unconditional `start()` would silently undo that.

## Accessibility of a route change

A route change fires neither `load` nor a document change, so assistive technology learns nothing:
focus dies with the `<a>` that the chrome just redrew, and the new `<title>` is not announced. Only
two things are actually required by WCAG 2.2, both level A:

| SC | Level | Required? |
|---|---|---|
| **2.4.2 Page Titled** | **A** | **Yes.** Understanding names SPAs explicitly |
| **2.4.3 Focus Order** | **A** | **Yes.** Focus dropped on `<body>` is a failure |
| 4.1.3 Status Messages | AA | **Mostly no** — it excludes anything delivered by a change of context. It bites on *loading* states, not route announcements |

So a route announcer is best practice, not conformance. The claim "4.1.3 requires one" is false.

What the router does: writes `document.title` and syncs the sr-only `<h1>`; focuses
`#maincontent` with `focus({preventScroll:true})` (scroll is handled a line earlier); announces the
page in `#fs-nav-status` (`role="status"`, `aria-live="polite"` — not `assertive`, for a
user-requested navigation). The two texts deliberately differ ("Skip to content" vs the page
name), which is the condition under which a focus move and a live region complement rather than
repeat each other.

**Keyboard activation gets the hybrid Sutton recommends**: `ev.detail === 0` on the click means the
link was activated from the keyboard, so `.fs-skip` takes focus — a small target with a visible
focus overlay, from which Enter jumps into the content. Pointer activation and `popstate` (input
modality unknown) keep focus on the wrapper, so the skip link does not flash on every mouse click.

Why not focus the `<h1>`: ours is clipped under `.fs-sr`, and focusing an invisible target tells a
sighted keyboard user nothing about where they are — and those are exactly the users the skip-link
variant serves.

## Scroll

`pushState` performs no scroll save/restore at all — those steps belong to document-changing
navigation and traversal, and the URL-and-history-update steps skip them. Three facts worth knowing
before touching this:

- **`history.scrollRestoration` is a property of the history ENTRY**, not a global. New entries
  inherit the active one's mode.
- **`manual` does not mean "it will land at 0"** — set the position explicitly, including to the top.
- **Keying a saved offset by URL is wrong** (A→B→A gives several entries with one URL), and
  restoring only works once the content has height.

**The two layouts genuinely scroll different elements** (measured, Software page, 1440×900):

| layout | document | `#maincontent` |
|---|---|---|
| `sidebar` | does not scroll | **scrolls** |
| `top` | **scrolls** | does not scroll |

So Back restores scroll in `top` and not in `sidebar` — the same theme behaving differently
depending on a client setting, which nobody chose. Fixed by saving `#maincontent.scrollTop`
explicitly, with one difference from the obvious sketch: **the offset is NOT kept in
`history.state`**, because Safari rate-limits history writes (100 per 30 s). `history.state` holds
only a session-unique entry id (`fsid`, stamped once per entry); the offsets live in an in-memory
`Map` in the router, which dies on a full load exactly when the browser takes over restoring
internal scroll regions. Saving happens at the two exit points (click and popstate, while the old
DOM is still on screen); restoring is a rAF loop until the height appears, cancelled by navigation
generation, capped at ~5 s.

`scrollRestoration` is deliberately left alone: `manual` is inert in `sidebar` (the document does not
scroll) and would take away working restoration in `top`.

## Boundaries and degradation

- Layout is irrelevant to the router: there is one renderer, and sidebar/top is a client attribute
  the CSS morphs.
- Third-party apps that register `view` nodes speed up automatically.
- **Status→Overview** (`template` node `admin_status/index`) is the SPA exception: its server
  template only defines three global helpers and calls `ui.instantiateView('status/index')`. The
  router reproduces that — `ensureOverviewHelpers()` defines the helpers idempotently (the
  template's inline script does not run under SPA), then instantiates `view.status.index`. Other
  `template` nodes → full navigation.
- Legacy `cbi` and `call`/`function` handlers → full navigation.
- Any require/instanceof error → `console.error(...)` and `window.location = pathname`. The error is
  **logged** deliberately: a silent fallback made every router regression look like "the page is
  just loading slowly".
- A cold route gets a placeholder immediately — `#view` used to hold the previous page under the new
  title until the view module arrived (measured at 600 ms latency: old content at 150 and 400 ms,
  a spinner only at 900 ms). The idiom is luci-base's own (`div.spinning` + the `Loading view…`
  msgid), so there is no jump on replacement and the string arrives translated.

## What is left alone, and why

Three kinds of not-doing, kept together so the next reader finds the answer before re-deriving it:
something measured and judged not worth fixing, something that cannot be fixed from here, and
something that must not be picked up again.

### Deliberately not fixed: timers a departing view leaves behind

**A departing view's `setTimeout` and rAF survive navigation.** The router hooks `setInterval` only.
Measured: `timeout 22 → 34 (+12) SURVIVED`, `interval 6 → 6 (+0) silenced`,
`raf 256 → 406 (+150) SURVIVED`.

But the measurement is synthetic — the tickers were planted by the test — and a search for a real
victim failed. Across every view on the router (6 installed `luci-app`s), every `setTimeout` is
one-shot: podkop's toast, package-manager's filter debounce, `system/reboot`'s modal,
`awaitReconnect`. There is not one self-rescheduling `setTimeout` or rAF loop; podkop's log
tailer, the thing this was for, runs on `setInterval` and is already covered.

**And a blind fix breaks real things**, also verified in the code: `ui.js` keeps tooltips, the
notification timeout and a `setTimeout(rejectFn, 1000)` on timers, so killing all pending
`setTimeout` on navigation breaks all of that. A blind `cancelAnimationFrame` **irreversibly breaks
`fs-fit.js`**: its callback clears the `_rafPending` flag, so a cancelled frame leaves the flag
`true` forever and the fitter dies silently for the rest of the document's life.

The asymmetry with `setInterval` is its own justification: the core uses `setInterval` for exactly
one thing, the `L.Poll` tick, which the hook explicitly preserves (`keep = L.Poll.timer`). "Kill
everything but one" is a correct operation there and has no equivalent for `setTimeout`/rAF. **If
such a view ever appears, the right answer is a targeted cancel through `onNavigate`, not a global
hook.**

### Still open: in-flight responses

**In-flight responses are not cancelled on leaving.** Measured: an XHR still in flight when you
navigate is still in flight afterwards and will arrive and run. There is nothing to cancel it with —
`L.Request` keeps its `xhr` in local state and accepts no `signal`. **Correctness is not affected**
(that is the generation counter's job), but it is waste: a ubus call the router will execute and
throw away, competing with the page the user actually opened. Honest conclusion: **only upstream can
fix this** (`L.Request` would have to accept a `signal`). Recorded so nobody hunts for a handle that
does not exist.

### Explicitly do not touch

- **Navigation API.** It is objectively the better model and cheaper than ours — one `navigate`
  event for every navigation including your own `pushState`, `NavigateEvent.signal`, `intercept()`
  with `focusReset`/`scroll`. We do not take it on support grounds: Baseline "newly available"
  only since January 2026 (Chrome/Edge since 2022, but **Firefox 147 and Safari 26.2 are January
  2026**), and a router is configured from whatever machine is to hand — a corporate Firefox ESR, a
  macOS stuck on Safari 18. `precommitHandler` is absent from Safari entirely. Revisit around 2027,
  as a feature-detected progressive enhancement.
- **`history.scrollRestoration = 'manual'`** — inert in `sidebar`, actively worse in `top`.
- **A second "does it fit?" observer** — that is `fs-fit.js`. See [conventions.md](conventions.md).

## Verified

- **No leaks, and that is a measurement.** 20 navigations across 4 pages, real listeners read
  through CDP `DOMDebugger.getEventListeners` (not a count of `addEventListener` calls — the browser
  deduplicates an identical type/ref/capture triple, and the naive counter lied, showing +5
  `window:click` per navigation that do not exist). `window` and `document` counts identical
  before and after; heap **10.0 MB → 10.0 MB**. The centralised `fs-fit.js` (one ResizeObserver for
  the document's life instead of one per view) is the structural reason this is clean.
- **A full walk of all 65 clickable nodes**, in both layouts, comparing each against a **real full
  load of the same URL**: **62 SPA-OK, 0 divergences, 3 fallbacks**. `data-page`, `dispatchpath`,
  `pathinfo`, URL and tab count all match; console clean. Back/Forward through a chain of alias and
  firstchild URLs (6 back + 3 forward): not one reload.
- Complex CBI form views (Interfaces, DHCP) render fully, the save/apply footer is present, pollers
  are alive.

**Trap when writing such a walk: do not iterate the tree's leaves.** A node with an `action` can have
children, and `alias`/`firstchild` nodes almost always do. A leaf walk skips exactly the 8 nodes
where the bug lived.

Another trap that cost a false alarm: `admin/status/channel_analysis` shows `.spinning` forever,
on SPA and on a full load alike. That is the page's own spinner (an airspace scan), not a stuck view
spinner. Compare against a full load, never against an expectation.
