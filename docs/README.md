# Documentation

Developer documentation for `luci-theme-footstrap`. Installing and using the theme is in the
[repository README](../README.md).

Every page here stands on its own — start wherever your question is.

## Start here

| [architecture.md](architecture.md) | What LuCI expects from a theme, and where footstrap plugs into it |
| [conventions.md](conventions.md) | The rules a patch must follow, and which gate holds each one |
| [development.md](development.md) | Bring up a dev router, push a change, prove it works |

## How it is built

| Page | Answers |
|---|---|
| [design-system.md](design-system.md) | Tokens, palettes, typography, scales, the appearance axes |
| [css.md](css.md) | The `styles/` tree, cascade layers, `build-css.sh`, proving a CSS change |
| [chrome.md](chrome.md) | Sidebar, icon rail, top bar, the menu renderer, the fit measurement |
| [spa-router.md](spa-router.md) | Client-side navigation: how it works and what it refuses to do |
| [third-party-apps.md](third-party-apps.md) | Coexisting with foreign `luci-app-*` |

## Shipping

| Page | Answers |

## For authors of other packages

| Page | Answers |
|---|---|
| [luci-app-styling-guide.md](luci-app-styling-guide.md) | How to style a `luci-app-*` so it works under any theme |
| [luci-app-styling-guide_ru.md](luci-app-styling-guide_ru.md) | The same guide in Russian — the one page here that is mirrored |

There is also a self-contained developer portal with the colour-token grid, the component markup
and a style checker: <https://vizzletf.github.io/luci-theme-footstrap/>.

## Not documentation

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `gallery.html` | every widget LuCI can emit, with the real class names — what the a11y gate runs against |
| `devkit.src.html` | source of the developer portal |
| `playground.src.html` | source of the playground: two real router pages, Status and System → Footstrap, with the axes live |
| `devkit.html`, `playground.html` | built from the two sources above by the `pages` job. Generated, gitignored, never committed |
| `design/`, `screenshots/`, `img/` | reference mock-ups and README assets |

## Conventions of these pages

- One page, one job. If a page needs its own table of contents, it is probably two pages.
- One fact lives in one place. Pages link to each other rather than repeating.
- Every measurement carries the number it was made with, and every rule says what it protects
  against — the alternative was usually tried and was worse.
- Documentation that has stopped being true is deleted, not annotated.
