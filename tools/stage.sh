# `owfeed build` packages a DIRECTORY; it does not build one. Everything the OpenWrt SDK
# used to do for us on the way in — concatenate the stylesheet, mangle the private custom
# properties, strip the comments out of the templates and the shell, stamp the version —
# has to happen before it, and that is what this file is. The one step it does NOT do is
# the translation catalogue: owfeed compiles the .po files itself (i18n: in owfeed.yml),
# byte-identical to po2lmo, so requiring po2lmo would put a C build of luci-base in front
# of anyone packaging this theme.
#
# THE ORDER IS THE MAKEFILE'S, and it is not arbitrary — see Build/Prepare in
# luci-theme-footstrap/Makefile, which this mirrors step for step:
#
#   1. copy       luci.mk's install mapping: htdocs -> /www, ucode -> /usr/share/ucode/luci,
#                 root -> /
#   2. build-css  cascade.css is generated from styles/ and is not in the tree
#   3. mangle     the private --fs-* names, reading the reserved set from the SOURCE
#   4. minify     terser over the staged JS (in CI this ran over the checkout, before the
#                 rsync into the SDK; there is no SDK now, so it runs over the staged copy)
#   5. strip      {# … #} out of the templates, whole-line # out of the shell
#   6. stamp      FS_VERSION, after the minify — minify-js.mjs keeps that declaration
#                 verbatim precisely so this sed still matches
#
# WHY THE LIFECYCLE SCRIPTS ARE EXTRACTED FROM THE MAKEFILE rather than kept as files
# beside it: they exist in the Makefile already, they are the thing an SDK build installs,
# and two copies of a postrm that only runs on somebody else's router months later is the
# worst duplication in this repo to let rot. The Makefile stays the single source; owfeed
# is handed what it holds. `$$` is make's escaping for a literal `$`, so it is undone here.
