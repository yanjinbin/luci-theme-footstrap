# PINNED TO A COMMIT AND CHECKSUMMED, because of what this file is: C source fetched
# over the network, compiled, and then run as the gate that decides whether our shipped
# JavaScript is safe. From a moving `master` the gate would be whatever upstream pushed
# last, and a bad day there — or a poisoned raw.githubusercontent cache — would silently
# rewrite the check itself. A commit SHA is immutable and the sha256 says so out loud.
# Both live in luci-theme-footstrap/luci-upstream.pin, which update-po.sh sources for its
# own borrowed tool: one file, so bumping upstream cannot leave half the toolchain behind.
#
# jsmin.c is byte-identical on openwrt-24.10 and master, so one build covers both
# releases this theme supports.
