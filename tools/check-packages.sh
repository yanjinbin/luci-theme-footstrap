# What `owfeed build` left in dist/, checked against what a release has to contain.
#
# THE CATALOGUES. A .lmo is a build artefact, not a file in git, and a silently missing
# one is the bug class this area keeps producing: every _() then renders its English
# msgid and nothing complains. Asserted against the tree the package actually carries
# rather than against what the build printed, and counted against the languages in the
# tree — so adding one and forgetting to wire it up fails here instead of shipping
# English to those users.
#
# Read out of the ipk because that container is a plain tar and the apk is not. Both
# legs are packed from the SAME staged directory by the SAME catalogue compiler, so one
# is enough to prove the compile happened.
#
# EXACTLY ONE THEME PACKAGE PER FORMAT, BY NAME. Load-bearing, not tidiness: anything
# resolving the theme by /luci-theme-footstrap[-_][^/]*\.EXT$/ and taking head -1 —
# release tooling, an install script, a person reading the assets list — mis-picks a
# stray extra asset that matches it. A per-language luci-i18n-footstrap package did
# exactly that (issue #6) and was installed AS the theme, reporting success.
