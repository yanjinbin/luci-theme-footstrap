/* The changelog contract (docs/releasing.md), held by a machine — because it drifts silently and the
 * release page is generated from it.
 *
 * THE BUG THIS EXISTS FOR, found by hand while cutting 0.9.2: `[Unreleased]` had accumulated a
 * DUPLICATE `### Changed` (and `Fixed` sat before `Removed`) across several commits, each of which
 * looked fine on its own. `tools/release-notes.sh` prints a header the first time it meets each
 * `###`, so the GitHub release would have carried TWO "Changed" groups. Nothing failed: not
 * `npm run check`, not the build, not the release job — the notes are generated at tag time, by
 * which point the tag is already pushed and the page already published.
 *
 * WHY A GATE AND NOT A REVIEW: every fault here is invisible in the diff that causes it. A commit
 * appends `### Changed` to the top of `[Unreleased]` without knowing another one added it at the
 * bottom; the mirror falls a bullet behind; a bullet loses its bold lead and simply never appears
 * in the release. All of them are one line, all of them survive review, and all of them are only
 * observable on a release page nobody re-reads.
 *
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT CHECKED: the prose. "Write the effect, keep the measurement, say what
 * the rule protects" (docs/releasing.md) is what makes an entry worth reading, and no scanner can judge it.
 * This holds the mechanical half — the half that breaks the generator.
