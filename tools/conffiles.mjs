/* Every shipped /etc/config/* must be declared a conffile — or the package manager eats it.
 *
 * THE BUG THIS EXISTS FOR, measured on the dev router, not reasoned:
 * `root/etc/config/footstrap` ships as an empty stub and is WRITTEN AT RUNTIME — Appearance ->
 * "Save as default" has rpcd uci-set the router-wide axes into that very file (fs-prefs.js
 * saveAsDefault()). With no `conffiles` define, the package manager owns it as an ordinary file
 * and REPLACES it on upgrade, so the admin's saved defaults were wiped by the theme's own
 * one-click Update — silently, and reported as success. The live router held eight options, was
 * package-owned, and had no `.conffiles` entry beside base-files'/dnsmasq's.
 *
 * WHY A GATE AND NOT JUST THE FIX: nothing observable fails. The wipe happens on someone else's
 * router, months later, at the moment they upgrade — the exact "silent, nobody reports it" class
 * the other gates here exist for. Adding a second config file and forgetting the define would
 * reintroduce it with no test, no lint and no diff to catch it.
 *
 * OpenWrt honours the define for BOTH formats (include/package-pack.mk: KEEP_$(1) -> apk
 * .conffiles / .conffiles_static, ipk CONTROL/conffiles), so one define covers 24.10's opkg and
 * 25.12's apk alike.
 *
 * Deliberately a TEXT check on the Makefile, not a package build: the gate must run on a dev box
 * and in the lint job, neither of which has an OpenWrt SDK.
