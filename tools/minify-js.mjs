/* Pre-minify the theme's shipped JS with terser, IN PLACE, before the SDK build.
 *
 * Why terser and not jsmin: jsmin strips comments and whitespace only — identifiers are wire
 * bytes, and uhttpd serves /www with no compression. Measured on this tree: jsmin ~57 KB,
 * terser (mangle toplevel) ~41 KB — −27%. Top-level mangling is safe BECAUSE a LuCI resource
 * file is evaluated inside a function wrapper: its top level is function scope, and everything
 * that crosses a module seam goes through undeclared globals (`L`, `E`, `_`, the `'require x
 * as y'` pragma aliases), which terser never renames.
 *
 * The CI build job runs this over the checkout and then builds with FOOTSTRAP_PREMIN=1, which
 * makes the theme Makefile set LUCI_MINIFY_JS:=0 — jsmin MUST NOT run over terser output:
 * terser legitimately emits `return/^v/.test(s)` shapes, the exact one-character-lookback trap
 * (openwrt/luci#8299) that eats the rest of the file and exits 0. A build without this step
 * (an SDK user, the buildbot) minifies the untouched source with jsmin as before; wrap-regex
 * and tools/jsmin-verify.mjs keep guarding that path.
 *
 * fs-version.js is special: Build/Prepare and dev-sync.sh stamp the git version by sed-ing the
 * declaration `const FS_VERSION *= *'…'` — so for that one file the name is RESERVED from the
 * mangle, quotes stay single, and the tool FAILS unless the declaration survives verbatim
 * enough for the sed to match. Silently losing it would make every release report "(dev)".
 *
 * THE SEAM NAMES ARE RESERVED, AND THE LIST IS DERIVED — this is what the paragraph above got
 * wrong, at the cost of a broken release. It is true that terser never RENAMES a free variable
 * like `L`; what it will happily do is CREATE one. A LuCI resource file is the body of
 * `function(window, document, L, …aliases)`, but terser is handed the file on its own, so to it
 * the top level is global scope and `L` is just a name nobody declared — i.e. a name it is free
 * to hand to a mangled variable. `fs-sheets.js` gained two top-level bindings, the generator
 * reached `L`, and the shipped file opened with `const L=…`: "Identifier 'L' has already been
 * declared", the module never loaded, and the whole chrome went with it (v0.11.6, pulled).
 *
 * So the free variables of the SOURCE are reserved, computed per file rather than listed: `L`,
 * `E`, `_`, `window`, `document`, every `'require x as y'` alias, every browser global the file
 * touches. A new seam name cannot be forgotten because nothing here names them.
 *
 * Three self-checks per file, because a silent mis-minify here ships broken chrome:
 *  - the output must PARSE (acorn, same options jsmin-verify uses);
 *  - the directive prologue must be IDENTICAL — the `'require x as y'` pragmas are how LuCI
 *    resolves dependencies, and a compress option that dropped them would leave every module
 *    loading with no dependencies and no error at minify time;
 *  - NOTHING the output declares may collide with a name the source uses freely. That is the
 *    check that would have caught the `const L` above; `reserved` is the fix, this is the proof,
 *    and they are derived from the same computation so they cannot disagree.
