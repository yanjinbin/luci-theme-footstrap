/* Shared harness for the two playwright gates that render docs/gallery.html: a11y-gallery.mjs
 * (axe, WCAG 2.2 AA) and export-tier.mjs (the outbound --*-color-* contract). Nothing here ships.
 *
 * Both gates repeated the same ~20 lines (serve the gallery on an ephemeral port, stamp the
 * Appearance axes onto :root). The stamping is what mattered: each gate's
 * `applyAppearance()` was one more copy of rules that already live in fs-prefs.js
 * and head.ut's pre-paint script — including the load-bearing one:
 *
 *     set --fs-tint-h BEFORE the data-tint attribute
 *
 * If the tint gains a second custom property, or accent joins the sweep, a forgotten copy goes on
 * testing the OLD shape and passing. A gate that silently measures the wrong thing is worse than
 * no gate. One copy.
