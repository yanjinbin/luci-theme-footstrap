/* A RATCHET on the stylesheet's shape: pin the numbers that only get worse by accident, so they
 * cannot drift up one commit at a time. Not style opinions; each is an invariant docs/conventions.md states
 * in prose and nothing enforced. (The CSS size budget and the font-byte budget this once cited as
 * precedent are both GONE — build-css.sh keeps only a broken-build floor.)
 *
 *   IMPORTANTS — which declarations may carry `!important` is documented: a fact about the
 *     cascade, not a preference. The count lives in LIMITS below and nowhere else — this header
 *     used to restate it and had already drifted a digit, which is the failure build.yml refuses
 *     to repeat by name. stylelint's `declaration-no-important` + allowlist stops a NEW file adding one;
 *     this stops the allowlisted files growing more. A RATCHET: it was 33 while three flags in base
 *     were fighting footstrap's own rules rather than an inline one — the cascade answers that with
 *     a later layer, so they are gone and the number came down with them. Tighten it again whenever
 *     a flag goes, so it cannot drift back.
 *   MAX SPECIFICITY — "do not let source order carry meaning… win on specificity instead." A rule
 *     needing a wilder selector than anything else is usually fighting a battle a cascade layer
 *     should have won for it.
 *   EMPTY RULES — always a mistake, and the concatenating build cannot see one.
 *
 * Lower a number when you make it true. Raising one is a decision, and wants a comment.
 *
 * Usage: node tools/css-metrics.mjs [--show]

	 * whose `*` selector cannot beat a component rule in its own layer any other way) + 8 (base).
	 *
	 * Raised 30 -> 31 for theme/45-misc.css's realtime-graph bleed. It is the sanctioned kind: the
	 * stock views size their drawing from #view but write `style="width:100%"` on the box they draw
	 * into, so inside our padded card the canvas is 34px short and the newest samples are clipped —
	 * and an inline declaration is exactly what no cascade layer can outrank.
	 *
	 * Lowered 31 -> 26: theme/65-dropdown.css's three `ul` margin flags were absorbed cargo from
	 * luci-theme-bootstrap (no @layer there) whose stated adversary — an inline `margin` from ui.js
	 * — does not exist on either release. They were beating the same FILE's open-popover
	 * `margin-top`; see the note there. */

	/* The widest selector the theme needs; see the layer rules in docs/conventions.md.
	 *
	 * Raised 6 -> 7 when the vertical sidebar's guard gained `:not([data-narrow])`. Not sprawl:
	 * the sidebar gives way to the bar when the CONTENT column would be too narrow, and that
	 * depends on the sidebar's own cut (224px expanded, 68px as a rail) — so it cannot be a
	 * media query and has to be an attribute. Every rule in the vertical and rail blocks
	 * therefore carries one attribute more; the deepest is the rail's paused-poll glyph at
	 * [1,7,0]. The ratchet did its job: it made the increase a decision, not a drift. */
