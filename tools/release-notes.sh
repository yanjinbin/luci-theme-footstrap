# Build the GitHub-release body from the CHANGELOG — it is GENERATED, never hand-written,
# so the changelog stays the single source.
#
# Every bullet is `- **one-line effect.** then the rationale` (docs/releasing.md). The bold lead is
# what a release reader wants; the rationale is for maintainers. So the notes are just those
# leads, grouped under their `### Fixed`/`### Added`/… headers. Consequences: a bullet with
# NO bold lead is silently omitted, and an empty section prints no header.
#
# CHANGELOG.md is primary; the CHANGELOG_ru.md mirror's summary is appended under a divider,
# so the release page carries both languages.
#
# Usage: release-notes.sh <version> [changelog-file]
#   <version>  e.g. 0.7.18 (no leading v); matches the `## [0.7.18]` heading.
# Prints to stdout. Pure sh + awk, so the release job needs no node.
