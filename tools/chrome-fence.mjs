/* The chrome is defended from third-party CSS in three places that must agree, and nothing held
 * them together. Proven, not assumed: breaking the fence constant to `.fs-sidebarTYPO` left the menu
 * completely unprotected and `npm run check`, `jsmin-verify` and `eslint` ALL exited 0.
 *
 *   1. `header.ut` — the markup. A chrome root MARKS itself with `data-fs-chrome`; the <nav> is one,
 *      and so are the skip link and the two sr-only elements, none of which is inside it. The mark is
 *      what the other two read.
 *   2. `fs-sheets.js` — CHROME_FENCE, appended to a foreign selector's subject so it can no longer
 *      MATCH a chrome element. This is what beats a third party's `!important`: there is nothing left
 *      to out-rank.
 *   3. `theme/10-chrome.css` — the pin, which closes the one way in a fence cannot: INHERITANCE from
 *      `html`/`body`, where no match is needed at all.
 *
 * The mark is DERIVED FROM THE MARKUP here, never restated: rename it in header.ut and this gate
 * re-derives it, then fails on the two copies that still say the old one. That is the whole point —
 * the failure it prevents has NO symptom. The fence silently stops fencing, every test stays green,
 * and the menu breaks on someone else's router months later, next to an app we never saw.
 *
 * The fence and the pin are each ONE canonical string, so this gate compares the whole string rather
 * than testing it for tokens. That is not pedantry — it is the hole the token version had. Its four
 * independent `includes()` checks all passed on `:where(:not(.fs-sidebar), .fs-sidebar *)`, a
 * plausible botched edit that is the exact INVERSE of a fence: it stops sparing the chrome and starts
 * TARGETING it. A gate whose thesis is "a stale copy just stops defending, silently" cannot be the
 * thing that waves that through.
 *
 * The shapes the strings encode, each a measured bug and not an imagined one:
 *  - `:where()` in both. It contributes ZERO specificity. Drop it from the fence and every app rule
 *    silently gains a point, re-ordering the app's stylesheet against itself on its own page. Drop it
 *    from the pin and the pin (0,1,0) starts fighting the chrome's own rules on source order.
 *  - The fence must cover the root AND its subtree (`[m], [m] *`); the root alone leaves every menu
 *    element inside it exposed.
 *  - The pin must cover the root ALONE, which it now states itself (`:not([m] *)`) instead of relying
 *    on nobody ever nesting a mark. Pinning descendants was measured and it broke the chrome's own
 *    inheritance: a direct declaration beats an inherited one even when the inherited one is ours,
 *    costing `.fs-label` its `nowrap` and forcing `text-align` from `start` to `left` on 302 elements
 *    — which breaks every RTL language LuCI ships.
 *  - The pin may only carry INHERITED properties. A non-inherited one there is a style decision
 *    wearing a guard's coat, and at 0,0,0 it would lose to everything anyway.
 *
 * Lastly it holds the dark-mode guard to `stampDark`: the guard exists because third parties write
 * the attributes this theme publishes (`luci-app-openclash`, seven templates). Add a fourth dialect
 * to stampDark and forget the observer's attributeFilter, and that dialect is unguarded — silently.
