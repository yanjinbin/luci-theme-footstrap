### Styles apps, not just the stock pages.

### Works on a phone.

### Light.

### Faster than bootstrap

### It can update itself.

### Have own appearence.


You pick **Footstrap** once in **System → System → Language and Style**. Every axis on the right is a
*client* preference: it applies instantly, with no reload.

- **Layout** — side menu or top bar
- **Theme** — auto (follows your OS), light or dark
- **Palette** — Footstrap (GitHub Primer colours) or Hi-Contrast
- **Density** — compact, normal or large
- **Wallpaper** — off, cats, or an image you upload
- **Tint** — washes one hue into the background, so you can tell which router a tab (or a screenshot
  in a ticket) belongs to
- **Accent** — re-hues buttons, toggles, sliders and focus rings
- **Rounding** — corner radius, 0–20px
- **Submenus** — keep several sections open, or auto-collapse to one

A set you like can be saved as the router-wide default, so a fresh browser starts from it.

## Install

```sh
wget -qO- https://gh-proxy.com/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yanjinbin/luci-theme-footstrap/main/install.sh | sh
```

Then pick **Footstrap** in **System → System → Language and Style**, field "Design". That is the only
thing you set on the router. For a specific version, pass the tag: `... | sh -s v0.9.0`.

## Building a luci-app?

<br clear="right">


The [developer devkit](https://vizzletf.github.io/luci-theme-footstrap/) has the colour token grid,
the component markup and a style checker you can paste into.

There is also a written guide:
[how to style a LuCI app so it works under any theme](docs/20-luci-app-styling-guide.md) — CSS
lifetime, namespacing, the colour contract, dark-mode detection, and what this theme does when an app
breaks the rules. Drawn from 30 real apps and checked on a router.
