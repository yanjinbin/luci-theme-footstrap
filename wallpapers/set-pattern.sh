# into /etc/config/footstrap — so nothing here is a private path or a private convention.

# The theme itself never fetches this: a theme in a package feed has no business calling a
# third-party host at run time. This script is the admin doing it deliberately, once. Apache-2.0.

Usage: set-pattern.sh <cats|dinos|URL|FILE|remove> [options]

  cats              870-unit tile, reads well around 440 px   (the default size)
  dinos             2048-unit tile, reads well around 880 px
  URL | FILE        any other SVG, fetched or copied as-is
  remove            delete the pattern and turn the wallpaper off

Options:
  --size N          tile edge in px, 40-1600      (default: per drawing, else 440)
  --strength N      layer opacity 0-100           (default: 20)
  --ink theme|original
                    theme    = the SVG supplies its alpha, footstrap supplies the colour
                    original = use the file's own colours, as a plain tiled image
  --keep-wallpaper  install the file but do not switch the router's wallpaper to Pattern

# matching and text matching guesses — which is why the handler pattern is `on` + letters + `=`
# and not `\son\w+=`: the loose one matches `only_selected="false"`, an ordinary Inkscape
# attribute, and it refused one of this project's own drawings on a real router. A file that trips
# a check here is refused rather than cleaned; upload it from the Appearance page if you disagree,
