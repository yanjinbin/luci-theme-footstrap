# luci-theme-footstrap + luci-app-footstrap-updater installer for OpenWrt 24.10 (ipk) and 25.12+ (apk).
#
# One-line install (run on the router over SSH):
#   wget -qO- https://gh-proxy.com/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yanjinbin/luci-theme-footstrap/main/install.sh | sh
# or:
#   curl -fsSL https://gh-proxy.com/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yanjinbin/luci-theme-footstrap/main/install.sh | sh
#
# Optional:
#   ... | sh -s -- --activate      # install and switch to Footstrap
#   ... | sh -s -- --upgrade       # upgrade an already installed theme to latest
#   ... | sh -s -- v0.10.3         # pin the THEME tag (the updater still takes its own latest)
#   ... | sh -s -- v0.10.3 --activate
#
# The installer ASKS whether to install the update checker (luci-app-footstrap-updater). Force the
# answer without a prompt (scripted installs):  FOOTSTRAP_UPDATER=1 (install) / =0 (theme only).
# GitHub downloads go through gh-proxy.com by default; override with GITHUB_PROXY=... or disable
# with GITHUB_PROXY=.
#
# SINCE THE SPLIT the theme and the updater ship from TWO repos with their own tags. This fork's
# installer defaults to this fork's theme releases; the updater stays on its upstream release feed
# unless FOOTSTRAP_UPDATER_REPO overrides it. The theme is always installed; the updater is OPTIONAL
# and the installer asks (or FOOTSTRAP_UPDATER=1/0 decides non-interactively). Licensed Apache-2.0.

# Decide whether to install the update checker (the luci-app-footstrap-updater package). It is the
# WHOLE of the "check for new versions / one-click Update" feature — no package, no update controls
# in the Appearance panel, no network calls to GitHub. So the choice is: do you want update checks?
#
# ASKED INTERACTIVELY, but read from /dev/tty, NOT stdin — and that is the crux of a `curl | sh`
# installer. In the documented one-liner `wget -qO- … | sh`, the shell is reading the SCRIPT from
# stdin (the pipe), so a plain `read` would swallow the rest of the script, not the user's answer.
# /dev/tty is the controlling terminal regardless of what stdin is, so the prompt works in BOTH the
# piped form and podkop's `sh -c "$(wget -qO- …)"` form. (podkop gets away with a plain `read`
# because its `sh -c "$(…)"` invocation leaves stdin ON the terminal; reading /dev/tty is the form
# that does not depend on how the user launched us.)
#
# FOOTSTRAP_UPDATER=1/0 forces the answer with no prompt (for scripted/cron installs). With no
# terminal and no override, default to installing it — that is the historical behaviour and the
# common want, and FOOTSTRAP_UPDATER=0 is the documented way to opt out non-interactively.

# --- download, verify, install --------------------------------------------
# TWO checks, answering DIFFERENT attackers, and both fail CLOSED.
#
#  - the ed25519 SIGNATURE is the one that matters. The sha256 cannot stand alone: GitHub
#    COMPUTES `@.assets[*].digest` from the uploaded bytes, so anyone who can replace a release
#    asset (a leaked write-scoped PAT — no CI run needed) gets the digest recomputed for them and
#    the checksum then cheerfully verifies the attacker's package. The signing key lives nowhere
#    in this repository and cannot be read back out of GitHub, so a replaced asset fails to
#    verify. `apk add --allow-untrusted` means the PACKAGE MANAGER holds no key of ours — it does
#    not mean the package is unverified; this script is what verifies it.
#  - the sha256 still earns its place: it catches a tampered or truncated download from the asset
#    CDN (a different host from api.github.com) with a clearer message. It does NOT remain if usign
#    is absent — nothing does: no usign is a REFUSAL below, which is correct and is the opposite of
#    what this comment used to promise.
#
# A MISSING digest or a MISSING signature is a REFUSAL, not a warning: half of a trust chain
# cannot be optional, and whatever empties it (a renamed field, an unexpected answer) leaves us
# installing bytes we cannot account for. FOOTSTRAP_ALLOW_UNVERIFIED=1 overrides — deliberately
# something you have to type, and its one honest use is pinning a release older than the signing
