# package format instead — see FALLBACK_BRANCHES_* below for why that is sound here.

# serves ARE the package-format split (apk from 25.12, ipk on 24.10), not a build of the
# theme per release. A snapshot has no branch of its own to install from, so it gets the
# newest one its package manager can read.
#
# What makes that sound for THIS package and not in general: it is noarch and
# `+luci-base` is its whole dependency list, so nothing in it was compiled against the
# branch it is fetched from. A package carrying a binary, or a versioned dependency,
# must not take this path.
#
# Newest first, and each candidate is probed rather than assumed: a branch listed here
# before it is published — or one that does not carry this router's architecture — falls
# through to the next instead of writing a repository entry that 404s on every update.
# The probe's bytes are discarded on purpose. Existence is all it asks, and the index it
# found is still verified by the package manager against the key pinned above, so a host
# that lies here buys a feed entry that then fails to verify rather than an install.
